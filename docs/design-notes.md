Development Workflow:

1. Project Setup
- Create virtual environment
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install development dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install pytest pylint mypy
  ```

2. Incremental Development Phases

Phase 1: Core Entities (Week 1)
- Implement base `Person` class in `src/core/person.py`
- Create `Member` and `Librarian` classes
- Write unit tests for each class
- Focus on inheritance and basic attribute management

Phase 2: Book and Library Systems (Week 2)
- Develop `Book` class with comprehensive methods
- Create `Library` class for managing collections
- Implement basic search functionality
- Write corresponding unit tests
- Add logging mechanisms

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
- Implement reservation system
- Add authentication mechanisms
- Create more complex search and recommendation features
- Develop error handling and custom exceptions

Phase 4: Data Persistence and Refinement (Week 4)
- Add JSON-based data storage
- Create methods for saving/loading library state
- Refactor and optimize code
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

3. Development Best Practices
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for all classes and methods
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use linters and type checkers

4. Testing Strategy
- Use pytest for unit testing
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use mock objects for complex interactions

5. Continuous Integration Suggestions
- Set up GitHub Actions for:
  * Running tests
  * Code quality checks
  * Automated linting

Sample Development Progression:
```python
